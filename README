### FORMATTING ###
- Python files have been formatted using 'black' and 'isort to pass Linter checks once implemented

### OVERVIEW ###
- This documentation provides a foundation for implementing RBAC with Okta, Terraform, and Python scripts. Adjustments may be needed based on specific organizational requirements and infrastructure configurations.

### CONFIGURE OKTA WITH TERRAFORM ###
- Map Okta groups using Terraform
- Automate the onboarding process for new users and assign appropriate roles in Okta

### PYTHON SCRIPTS ###
- Use Python scripts to get information about users and their roles
- Use a Python script to get Okta logs

### TRIGGER TERRAFORM DEPLOYMENT WITH PYTHON ###
- Use Python to trigger a Terraform deployment if there are changes in Okta made outside of this script
- Compare the current state (e.g., the list of users fetched from Okta) with a previously stored state. If there are differences, the script would indicate changes, and a Terraform deployment is triggered, so to reflect in Okta what it's declared in main.tf

### MONITOR AND UPDATE PERMISSIONS ###
- Implement a periodic run of any script that checks for changes in Okta, so to trigger Terraform deployments accordingly
- Scheduler.py will execute scripts every day at 2:30 PM or every hour according to preferred settings
