### OVERVIEW ###
- This documentation provides a foundation for implementing RBAC with Okta, Terraform, and Python scripts. Adjustments may be needed based on specific organizational requirements and infrastructure configurations.

### CONFIGURE OKTA WITH TERRAFORM ###
- Map Okta roles using Terraform
- Automate the onboarding process for new users and assign appropriate roles in Okta using a null_resource and the local-exec provisioner to execute a curl command for creating a new user via Okta's API

### PYTHON SCRIPTS ###
- Write Python scripts to automate tasks related to RBAC
- Automate the provisioning of users and their roles in Okta using Python, with Okta API
- Use Terraform Python libraries to trigger Terraform deployments based on changes in Okta (e.g., when users are added or removed from groups)

### TRIGGER TERRAFORM DEPLOYMENT WITH PYTHON ###
- Create a Python script that triggers triggers a Terraform deployment if there are changes with Okta users, roles and permissions
- Compare the current state (e.g., the list of users fetched from Okta) with a previously stored state. If there are differences, the script would indicate changes, and a Terraform deployment is triggered

### MONITOR AND UPDATE PERMISSION ###
- Implement a periodic run of any scripts that check for changes in Okta, so to trigger Terraform deployments accordingly
- Run the main scheduler:
    python scheduler.py
This will execute scripts every day at 2:30 PM or every hour according to preferred settings


### TESTING ###
- Ensure that users have the correct access based on their role by simulating changes in roles or permissions to validate that the system can adapt accordingly, for instance:
    Adding a new role to a user
    Removing a role from a user
    Modifying role permissions
using the relevant Python scripts

### CONCLUSIONS ###
- RBAC setup ensures secure and efficient management of user access to resources. Regularly review and update roles and permissions to align with organizational changes.
